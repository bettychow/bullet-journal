# My Bullet Journal

Have you heard of the paper bullet journal? It actually involves a system of recording your tasks, events, gaols, etc. It is much more than a planner/calendar. 

I decided to build a digital verison of the bullet journal. The advantages of my digital bullet journal over paper ones are:
1. Users can upload picture of the day. No need to print and paste picture.
2. Users who record their happy moments can see all the happy moments for their days in a month colectively. Reading all the happy moments in each month remind users what make them happy.
3. Users can edit/delete entries easily. 

I plan to expand this project to include more functions.

To use the journal:
1. Fork this repo.
2. Open index.html page in browser.
